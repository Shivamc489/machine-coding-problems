# Machine Coding Practice

This repository is dedicated to practicing machine coding problems and fostering peer code reviews. The main branch contains only this README, while individual problems are implemented in separate pull requests that remain unmerged.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to:
1. Implement solutions to various machine coding problems
2. Provide a platform for peer code reviews
3. Improve coding skills through practice and feedback

## How It Works

1. Each problem is implemented in a separate branch and submitted as a pull request
2. Pull requests are not merged but remain open for review and discussion
3. Colleagues can review the code, provide comments, and suggest improvements

## Problems

The problems implemented in this repository are inspired by the list provided at [workat.tech](https://workat.tech/machine-coding/article/how-to-practice-for-machine-coding-kp0oj3sw2jca). Some examples include:

- Snake and Ladder Game
- Parking Lot
- Tic Tac Toe
- Text Editor
- Elevator System

## How to Run

To review a specific problem:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-coding-practice.git
   ```

2. Check out the branch for the problem you want to review:
   ```
   git checkout problem/snake-and-ladder
   ```

3. Follow the specific instructions in the problem's README file to run and test the implementation

## Contributing

To contribute a new problem solution:

1. Create a new branch from main:
   ```
   git checkout -b problem/your-problem-name
   ```

2. Implement your solution
3. Create a pull request with a detailed description of the problem and your approach

## Code Review

To review a colleague's code:

1. Go to the "Pull Requests" tab in the GitHub repository
2. Select the pull request you want to review
3. Use GitHub's review features to comment on specific lines or provide overall feedback

Happy coding and reviewing!
